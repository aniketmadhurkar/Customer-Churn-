## Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Use Case

This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution to predict customer churn for the organization "No-Churn." The objective is to identify customers who are likely to churn and create actionable insights to enhance customer retention strategies. The project involves building a predictive model, assigning churn risk scores, and implementing strategies to mitigate churn.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data, understand the factors influencing churn, and build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of churn. By introducing a new predictive variable, CHURN-FLAG, the model identifies customers with high churn probability, enabling targeted retention campaigns and proactive measures in customer care and support.

# Key Features

# Data Preprocessing

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical variables and standardized numerical features for better model performance.

Addressed class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or oversampling.

# Feature Engineering

Derived new features based on customer behavior and historical data.

Selected important features through correlation analysis, mutual information, and feature importance scores.

# Model Training

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

XGBoost

# Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)

# Dataset

The dataset contains features related to customer demographics, account details, and interaction history. Key features include:

Numerical Features: Monthly charges, tenure, total spend, etc.

Categorical Features: Contract type, payment method, customer support interactions, etc.

Target Variable: CHURN-FLAG (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

# Results

The models were evaluated on a test dataset, and the best performance achieved was:

Accuracy: 92.4%

Precision (for churn customers): 87.5%

Recall (for churn customers): 89.2%

AUC-ROC: 0.95
Detailed insights, including feature importance and confusion matrices, are documented in the final report.

Retention Strategies

Churn Risk Scores: Customers are assigned a churn risk score to prioritize retention efforts.

Email Campaigns: Targeted offers and personalized communication for high-risk customers (CHURN-FLAG = 1).

Customer Support:

Proactive follow-ups for high-risk customers.

Auto-categorizing tickets from these customers as high priority for faster resolution.

Touchpoint Optimization:

Streamlined request fulfillment processes.

Enhanced customer care support for quick issue resolution.

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

## Future Work

Hyperparameter Tuning: Further optimize the model for better performance.

Integration with CRM: Embed the churn prediction model into a CRM system for real-time churn risk assessment.

Deep Learning Models: Experiment with advanced architectures like neural networks.

Dashboard Deployment: Develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing churn insights and tracking retention efforts.
